        <h2 id="tribute-info-title">Here's a time line of Dr. Tom Zé's life:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1936 -</strong> Born in Irará, Bahia - Brazil. He was a very curious kid and little details of the world around him always messed with his head. </li>
            <li><strong>50's - </strong>He used to love music since really woung, listening to brazilian great musicians like Luiz Gonzaga and Jackson do Pandeiro. A little harmonica was his first experience in the world of music, but discovering the acoustic guitar, when he was 17, would change his life forever.</li>
            <li><strong>60's - </strong>Start to study music in Bahia Federal University University, where years later he would become a harmony professor.  At university, he was one of the founding members of the Bahia Composers Group, one of the reasons for his erudit root that would be a characteristic in his career. The acossiation in the past years with Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gau Costa and many other important brazilian artists made them the seeds of what was going to be the brazilian tropilism. In 1968 he moved to São Paulo. In this year, he won the fourth Brazilian Popular Music Festival with the song "São Paulo, meu amor". Also in this year, released his first album:  Tom Zé - Grande Liquidação and participate in Tropicália – Panis et circensis, a really provocative album.What an year!

            <li><strong> 1973 - </strong> Release of his third album "Todos os olhos". Probably the most controversial in his career, as it was censored by the totalitary brazilian's government because of the front cover.</li>
            <li><strong> 1976 - </strong> Release of his fourth album "Ensinando o Samba". Here, the most clear signal that he was taking the experimental music direction, which would be his career choice from this time on.</li>
            <li><strong>Latest 80's - </strong> David Byrne (Talking Heads) in a trip to Brazil, discovers Tom Zé accidentally and get very impressed. This acossiation was a re-emergy for Tom Ze's career. He released a compilation and two albums, all of which received positive reviews from critics in the United States. </li>
